The participants will be put into groups of similar&nbsp;characteristics that are of interest to the topic being researched. This doesn't however mean that they should have similar&nbsp;attitudes, demographics, experiences etc in general – only the characteristics of interest to the research should be&nbsp;similar.&nbsp;Focus groups are typically longer in length than in-depth interviews as you need to consider the group interactions&nbsp;and discussions. They tend to last around 90 minutes, but this will depend on the nature of your research. Consider how&nbsp;many questions or topics you need to get through in the time allocated.&nbsp;​</p><p>The moderator is there to:&nbsp;​</p><ul><li><p>encourage interaction among group members​</p></li><li><p>ensure everyone has the chance to participate​</p></li><li><p>regulate dominant group members​</p></li><li><p>keep the conversation on track​</p></li><li><p>summarise any points made by participants.&nbsp;​</p></li></ul><p>The moderator needs to be impartial and non-judgemental.&nbsp;​</p><p>This is a less directive style of interviewing from the moderator than with in-depth interviews.

If you decide that online works best for your research, there are&nbsp;further things that&nbsp;you will&nbsp;need to consider:&nbsp;​</p><p>​<br /><strong>Ensuring appropriate environments</strong></p><p>Participants sometimes find online research less formal, and whilst this does have its&nbsp;benefits, they should ensure that&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;in an appropriate environment to take part. For&nbsp;example, you want participants to be engaged, and not laying down in bed or watching TV.&nbsp;You’ll&nbsp;also need to consider whether the conversation could be overheard, especially in the&nbsp;context of the sensitive topics. For example, if the participant is in a café taking part in the&nbsp;research over Skype, Teams or Zoom,&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;likely that&nbsp;passersby&nbsp;will be able to listen&nbsp;in.&nbsp;When arranging interviews, provide guidance to participants regarding the&nbsp;environment&nbsp;they should undertake the study in.​</p><p>You should also ask participants to minimise any distractions. For&nbsp;example&nbsp;turning their&nbsp;phone on&nbsp;silent, or&nbsp;asking them not to check their emails for the duration of the session.&nbsp;​</p><p>Give participants the option to put their cameras on. Having cameras turned on can make it&nbsp;easier for the interviewer to see if someone is trying to speak. This can also help to build&nbsp;rapport.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accessibility and technology</strong></p><p>You’ll&nbsp;need to consider accessibility needs for everyone to be able to participate online. Does&nbsp;everyone in your sample have access to the internet? Can they all use a technological device needed&nbsp;for the research?​</p><p>Provide instructions on how to access or download the platform you intend to use&nbsp;e.g.&nbsp;Zoom,&nbsp;Microsoft Teams, Google Meet etc. Ensure that everyone can access the platform before the research&nbsp;starts.​</p><p>If conducting research in a large group, consider using breakout rooms. It may be beneficial to have a&nbsp;facilitator in each group to capture conversation and keep the conversation on track where necessary.&nbsp;​</p><p>Be aware of technical limitations, for example when conducting an interview, consider having a&nbsp;telephone number you can call as a&nbsp;back up&nbsp;option if technology fails you.​</p><p>Consider using the chat function or other online tools during the research, for example a Miro Board.&nbsp;This may help to keep participants engaged.&nbsp;You would&nbsp;need to check everyone has access&nbsp;beforehand. Also think about the sensitivity of the topic before introducing other online tools.&nbsp;​</p><p>Consider GDPR – for example, how does the platform&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;using store information? Do you need&nbsp;secure connections? Ensure you adhere to company guidelines.&nbsp;​</p><p>Think about how&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;going to record and transcribe your interview or focus group. Does the&nbsp;platform&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;using have the functionality to do this for you, or will you have to prepare to do this&nbsp;yourself?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Communications</strong></p><p>Schedule a calendar invite with appropriate reminders. People will be&nbsp;busy with their day-to-day lives, so give them gentle reminders so that&nbsp;they don’t forget the time and/or date of the research.​</p><p>Let participants know how you want them to communicate during the&nbsp;research. For example, if in a focus group, do you want participants to&nbsp;use the ‘hands up’ function, or can they just jump in and start talking?&nbsp;If being conducted online and the platform has a chat function, let&nbsp;participants know that they can use that function if they don’t feel&nbsp;comfortable speaking aloud. If conducting a focus group and&nbsp;encouraging use of the chat function, it might be beneficial to have&nbsp;someone with you to monitor the chat. Set these expectations of how&nbsp;you want participants to contribute, before discussing your topics of&nbsp;interest.</p>",
